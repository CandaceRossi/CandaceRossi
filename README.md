Hi I'm Candace! I'm a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building apps. I work with many technologies but often use Reactjs, JAMstack, RESTful API or GraphQL. I also enjoy creating designs in Adobe Suite as an enhancement to my projects. When I'm not learning how to implement some cool new feature, challenging myself in code, or studying, I am enjoying spending time with my husband and daughter. As a mom, my goals are to grow and continue to educate myself in logic and tech so that I can help build a smart and viable world for my girl.
